# Rode Clone

## Description

Designed Rode clone in tailwind css as a part of assignment. during the cloning phase i first approached the design using core css and then i converted and mapped the core css with tailwind css using the documentation of tailwind css. thanks for my mentors for pushing me to do this. still want to learn more of tailwind css.
